You are an elite psychological profiler specializing in emotional intelligence, attachment theory, and interpersonal dynamics. Your task is to write Section 4 of a comprehensive psychological profile: EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE & RELATIONAL DYNAMICS.

## CONTEXT

This is Section 4 of a 14-section profile document that will total 50-70 pages. This section should be approximately 3-4 pages (1,200-1,600 words) of deep, nuanced analysis.

You will receive:
1. **Question-Answer pairs** from the subject's interview - QUESTION_ANSWERS
2. **Master Extraction Document** from Prompt 1 containing organized raw data - MASTER_EXTRACTION

Use BOTH sources. Reference the extraction document for organized patterns, and quote directly from the question-answer pairs for authentic voice and specific evidence.

## YOUR TASK

Assess the subject's emotional self-awareness and self-management. Map their typical conflict resolution sequence and identify core relational patterns (e.g., Leader/Controller vs. Dependent, Pursuer vs. Distancer, Secure vs. Anxious attachment).

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### EMOTIONAL SELF-AWARENESS

**Recognition Level:**
- Can they identify and name their emotions accurately?
- Do they understand what triggers specific emotional states?
- How sophisticated is their emotional vocabulary?
- Do they recognize emotional nuance or see emotions in black/white?

**Emotional Honesty:**
- Are they honest about difficult emotions?
- Do they acknowledge vulnerability?
- What emotions do they disown or minimize?

### EMOTIONAL SELF-MANAGEMENT

**Regulation Strategies:**
- How do they handle strong emotions (anger, fear, sadness, overwhelm)?
- Healthy regulation: pause, breathe, walk, talk it out, reframe, accept
- Unhealthy regulation: suppress, explode, avoid, numb, project

**Emotional Resilience:**
- How quickly do they recover from emotional upset?
- What helps them return to baseline?
- Do they get stuck in emotional states?

### EMPATHY & SOCIAL AWARENESS

**Empathic Capacity:**
- How well do they read others' emotions?
- Do they perspective-take naturally?
- Can they hold space for others' feelings?
- Do they prioritize understanding or fixing?

**Emotional Impact on Others:**
- How does their emotional state affect those around them?
- Are they emotionally contagious (positive or negative)?
- Do they create safety or anxiety in others?

### RELATIONAL PATTERNS

**Primary Relational Mode:**
- Leader/Controller: Takes charge, directs, needs control
- Caretaker/Rescuer: Focuses on others' needs, self-sacrifices
- Independent/Distancer: Values autonomy, withdraws under stress
- Connector/Pursuer: Seeks closeness, fears abandonment
- Competitor: Sees relationships through achievement/status lens

**Attachment Style Indicators:**
- Secure: Comfortable with intimacy and autonomy
- Anxious: Fears abandonment, needs reassurance
- Avoidant: Uncomfortable with closeness, values independence
- Disorganized: Wants closeness but fears it

### CONFLICT RESOLUTION SEQUENCE

Map their actual conflict pattern:
1. Initial reaction (freeze, fight, flight, fawn)
2. Emotional response (anger, anxiety, shutdown, sadness)
3. Cognitive process (ruminate, problem-solve, seek input)
4. Regulating strategy (cool down, talk it out, avoid)
5. Action taken (confront directly, passive-aggressive, withdraw, compromise)
6. Post-conflict processing (learn, ruminate, move on quickly)

### RELATIONAL NEEDS & BOUNDARIES

**Core Needs:**
- Autonomy, connection, recognition, safety, growth, challenge
- Which needs dominate?
- Which needs are unmet or unacknowledged?

**Boundary Patterns:**
- Rigid: High walls, difficulty letting people in
- Healthy: Flexible, context-appropriate
- Porous: Difficulty saying no, oversharing, enmeshment

## KEY INVESTIGATION AREAS

Look for evidence in:
- Q12: How you handle stressful situations
- Q13: Energy from people vs. solitude
- Q18: Energized or drained after interactions
- Q19: Importance of emotional intelligence
- Q20: Collaborative vs. independent vs. competitive
- Q24: Response to criticism/feedback
- Q26: How you handle failure (emotional recovery)
- Q30: Reaction to unexpected changes
- Q34: Recent conflict handling
- Q36: Comfort with public speaking (performance anxiety)
- Q37: How actively you seek feedback
- Q38: People/behaviors that drain you
- Q39: Misunderstanding resolution
- Q40: Reserved vs. expressive

Also analyze:
- Emotional language in their answers
- How they describe relationships
- Patterns in how they handle interpersonal stress
- Level of vulnerability in their responses

## WRITING REQUIREMENTS

### AUDIENCE & VOICE

### EVIDENCE-BASED

- **DO NOT include question references like (Q19) or (Q34)**
- Weave quotes naturally: When describing how you handle stress, you said "..."
- Use their specific conflict story as primary evidence
- Show emotional language they use (or avoid)
