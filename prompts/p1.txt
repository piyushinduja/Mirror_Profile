## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. **BE EXHAUSTIVE**: Extract EVERYTHING. This document is the foundation for 14 detailed sections totaling 50-70 pages. Do not summarize—extract.

2. **QUOTE DIRECTLY**: Use the subject's exact words frequently. Preserve their voice.

3. **IDENTIFY PATTERNS**: When something appears multiple times across different answers, note it explicitly.

4. **FLAG CONTRADICTIONS**: When answers contradict each other, document both sides.

5. **DIFFERENTIATE STATED VS. REVEALED**: Always distinguish between what they SAY about themselves and what their BEHAVIORS/CHOICES reveal.

6. **NO INTERPRETATION YET**: This is extraction and organization, not analysis. Save deep interpretation for the section prompts.

7. **CROSS-REFERENCE QUESTIONS**: Note which question numbers provide evidence for each extraction.

8. **PRESERVE NUANCE**: Don't flatten complexity. If something is ambiguous or contradictory, preserve that.
